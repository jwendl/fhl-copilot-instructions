# Fix-Hack-Learn Copilot Instructions

## Markdown Files and Example Project(s)

The intention of this project is to provide some example Markdown files of opinated copilot instructions to assist service and game client development using .NET and / or Unreal Engine.

We will loosely base our files on the [Awesome Copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) and [Awesome Copilot Instructions](https://github.com/Code-and-Sorts/awesome-copilot-instructions) repository.
