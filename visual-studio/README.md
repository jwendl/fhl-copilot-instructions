# Visual Studio / .NET / Bicep

The Visual Studio / .NET / Bicep copilot instructions folder will contain a copilot-instructions.md file from which we will use as the final resulting project. It will also contain a folder for each model we tested the copilot instructions with and it's resulting source code.
