# Example Project Prompt

This is intended to be a copy / pasteable prompt to feed into GitHub copilot to give it a complex enough of a business scenario. This business scenario will hopefully highlight all of the edge cases that pop up when building a solution to a complicated problem.

```
We are building a Dungeons and Dragons Treasure Generator. This application will use the following technology stacks:

- .NET 9.0
- ASP.NET Blazor for User Interfaces
- Fluent Blazor
- Bicep for Azure deployment
- Entity Framework Core for Database calls

We want to replicate the random treasure tables inside the Dungeon Master's guide for D&D 2024 edition in the chapter titled "Random Magic Items".

Please build all the related project(s) and artifacts to build the application and deploy the application to Azure.

Please put the solution and all projects under c:\source\GitHub\dnd-treasure-generator
```
